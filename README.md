## 📘 Overview

The **Automated Course Development (ACD)** Model is an AI-powered Streamlit application designed for **SMEs, content creators, and educators**.  
It enables effortless course creation by dynamically generating **course outlines, detailed modules, and quizzes** based on inputs such as *Course Name, Difficulty Level, and Number of Modules*.  

This tool not only creates **comprehensive and customizable course content**, but also allows users to **download results as neatly formatted PDFs and PPTs**.  
By leveraging advanced LLMs (like GPT and LLaMA), ACD streamlines the entire course design process — from planning to delivery — saving time while enhancing quality.
